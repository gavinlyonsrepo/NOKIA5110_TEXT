// Define the ASCII table as Data array
// cols left to right 0x00 is  off 0xFF is all on
// Each character is 7 bits wide one byte height. 
// so ! is 0x5f,0x5f,0x00,0x00,0x00,0x00,0x00,0x00 , Also the code adds two blank lines on LHS and RHS side 
// Each character is in a 9 by 8 bit pixel box.
// NO LOWERCASE LETTERS
